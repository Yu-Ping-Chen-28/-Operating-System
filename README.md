# Operating-System
NYCU-Institute of Computer Science and Engineering-CSIC30015

## course overview
This course is an advanced version of the undergraduate course "Introduction to Operating System". Generally, most topics are the same as those of the undergraduate counterpart, but we will dive deeper to explore how are those topics implemented in Linux and what is the trend or challenge for each topic. For each topic, we will revisit key concepts provided in the undergraduate OS, and then move to advanced topics, mostly from selected papers. We will also have some hands-on projects on Linux, such as playing with kernel system call and CPU scheduling.
